    <p>Hi Caroline Sprenkle,</p>

    <p>

    I noticed that you are (a/the) Science Teacher at Roosevelt High, and I wanted to reach out about a
    service learning project with the nonprofit <a href="https://www.tree-plenish.org/">Tree-Plenish</a>
    that would be perfect for your students.

        Tree-Plenish is an environmental organization run by college students to help high schools offset
        their paper usage by hosting tree planting events. In working with Tree-Plenish, you and your students
        will set a tree goal based on your school’s paper consumption. From there, your students will encourage
        residents to request saplings to be planted in their yard or volunteer to plant saplings on the day of
        the event. This event would come at no cost to you, and Tree-Plenish will provide mentorship during the
        planning process and saplings to be planted on the day of the event. It’s like a project in a box!
    </p>
    <p>

        I’m reaching out to you because Kenwood Community School hosted a Tree-Plenish event last year with great
        success, planting 164 trees in their community.

        If you’d like to learn more about hosting an event with us, make sure to take a look at our
