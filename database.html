   <h2>Scalable Solutions</h2>
	<p style="text-align:left;font-size:16px;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px">Tree-Plenish is a rapidly growing organization, going from 2 -> 87 -> 473 events over the last three yearly cycles. To maintain logistic and financial capabilities a centralized and automated system is needed. This requires many seperate integration and automation tasks due to Tree-Plenish's unique event model.</p>
	<!-- <p style="text-align:left;font-size:16px;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px">DESCRIPTION</p> -->
	<br>
	
	<h3>Centralized Database</h3>
	<img src="tpdbd.png" alt = "Database Diagram" width="800" style="float:center">
	<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px">To accomplish this, all internal and forward-facing operations are built around a centralized database. This database is connected to multiple POEs, mainly student-completed typeforms and internal data sheets. It is currently hosted with Amazon RDS and is managed in conjunction with the head of data engineering.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Typeform Automation</h3>
	<img src="typeformAutoEx.png" alt = "Automatically Generated Student Forms" width="800" style="float:center">
	<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px">To handle the many sources of POE data without hindering user experience, the Typeform API was used to create a robust form generation and processing software. This project is capable of automatically creating the neccessary sponsorship, purchase, and volunteer forms for each school with generic templates. The software also processes the responses from all forms in the templated group to maintain a centralized record.

	<h3>General Integrations & Misc. Scripts</h3>
	<img src="mainSh.png" alt = "main.sh chunk" width="800" style="float:center">
	<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px">While the typeform-auto handles almost all forward-facing input, there is a variety of processing and integration tasks that must be run periodically. These are executed on a local server and account for a large part of the logistic tasks neccessary to carry out events. As such, the number of Tree-Plenish employees needed to carry out the event cycle has dropped from 40 to 28, while the event capacity has increased by 10 to 15 times from last year's.
