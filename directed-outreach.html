	<p>Various software and processes used in directing a nationwide targeted advertising campaign.</p>
	
   <h2>Email-Drips</h2>
	<p style="text-align:left;font-size:16px;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px">Custom email automation software designed to utilize Tree-Plenish's unique student network. Incorporates two seperate familiarity modes, engagement tracking, and traditional message personalization. Used for >10,000 administrator, teacher, and club advisor addresses obtained through a combination of manual retrieval, and past email lists.</p>

	<h3>Local Ambassador - Familiarity Networking</h3>
	<img src="senderMap.png" alt = "SEIR Model Fitting" width="800" style="float:center">
	<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px">To take advantage of Tree-Plenish's staff across the country, the "Local Ambassador" module spoofs the sender & signoff information of an employee in a geographically advantageous position to highlight our locality. The distribution was assigned algorithmically using weighted distances.  (Note: All names used had volunteered).</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>Regional Success Indicator - Familiarity Networking</h3>
	<img src="regSucc.png" alt = "SEIR Model vs Actual" width="800" style="float:center">
	<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px">To take advantage of last year's events a regional indicator is used in the relevant territories. This translates into an added paragraph describing the closest event's successes to show the applicability for a Tree-Plenish event in the region.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>Read Receipts - Engagement Tracking</h3>
	<img src="adminEmailResults.png" alt = "Admin Email Results" width="800" style="float:center">
	<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px">Our engagement tracking system was incorporated by embedding redirecting links into the email content. From this data we can analyze trends in time-based engagement as well as modify follow-up content tuned to how many emails had been opened (see the engagement tracking page for more info on our ethical concerns and privacy protection).</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>Template and Results</h3>
	<img src="tpSampleEmail.png" alt = "Sample Email" width="800" style="float:center">
	<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px">Overall, the campaign has been showing a 15% conversion rate from engagement (opened email) to further communication. Using last year's last-mile conversion rate of 35% and average event revenue (~$1000), we have a very healthy ROAS of ~45, meaning that each dollar spent on technical infrastructure and AWS services for this campaign will return $45 in revenue.</p>
