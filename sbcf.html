	Economically, we identified a 41% discrepancy between mean in district and out of district donations. We also found a 5% to 24% increase in the normalized mean home price of out of district donors. Occupationally, we found that occupations with a social stake in their communities contributed more in district (e.g, educators at 41.6% in district) vs. those without it (e.g, executives at 17.3% in district). Lastly, we found evidence of increased support of racial minorities among out of district donors, indicating the duality of out of district donations to support historically underrepresented candidates.
